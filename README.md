# PoeTools

- TODO: ...

- Manager classes have either "Poe1" or "Poe2" prefix 
  - Overridden Manager and Config classes from the GameToolsLib are in "lib/core" 
  - Most code will be implemented in a "lib/modules/MODULE", but shared code will be put in "data", "domain", or 
    "presentation"

- Helper classes in shared module have either "Poe" prefix for classes to extend from or "Shared" for mixins to 
  implement

- more details in project specific readme files
